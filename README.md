# music-aggregator
I like songs, Spotify has an API, so I collect latest songs for my favorite artist in a single playlist

I get poor recommendations in my `release radar` playlist so I made this. This works best when you have a playlist of songs with similar genre or artists. It will get songs within a given time span or latest songs for your top artists not Spotify's recommended artists. You can go that way too and get a playlist with new songs from **(new)** artist related to your top artist.
